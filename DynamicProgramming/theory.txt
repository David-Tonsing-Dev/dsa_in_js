Terminologies:
    1. Memoization: Process of storing the answer of sub-problem.

Overlapping Subproblem: The exact same problem repeating with the same exact output.
Optimized Substructure: 
    example:
        A----10----B
        |          |
        30         15
        |          |
        C----20----D

        the optimal way to reach from A -> D is by finding 
        - Optimal way to A -> and B -> D 
        - Which will provide the overall optimal way to reach A -> D

        But if instead:

        A -> C and C -> D the overall will not be optimal.

        **NOTE: 
        - We must have overlappign Subproblem
        - We need to have optimize sub-structure
