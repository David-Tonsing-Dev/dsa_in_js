Hash table:

Terminologies: 
    1. One way- give input will produce some value as index, but you cant produce the same value using the output index/value
    2. Determistic -  For each input will have some output vavlue, and will only give the same output value when provided the same input.
    3. Collision - When input is given, if the output/produce some value is already exist.

Handling Collision:
    1. Separate Chaining
    2. Linear probing (open addressing)


Big O:
    O(1);
    Though collision can make it O(n) but its very rare
