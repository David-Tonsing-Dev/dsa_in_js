Heap tree;

    1. The parents node will always be greater than its decendent
    2. It is alway complete
    3. It can have duplicate node
    4. We can have max/min heap. Max heap means the root will node will always be greater

Store heap:
    1. Store the integer in the array
    2. Start from index 0 adjacent to the root
    3. Two way to store:
        3.1 Store start from index 0
        3.2 Store start from index 1 left the index 0 empty
    
For index 0 is empty:
    Finding its decendent using parent index:
        leftChildIndex = 2 * parentIndex;
        rightChildIndex = 2 * parentIndex + 1;

    Finding its parent using decendent index;
        parentIndex = Math.floor(childIndex/2);

For index 0 is not empty:
    Finding its decendent using parent index:
        leftChildIndex = 2 * parentIndex + 1;
        rightChildIndex = 2 * parentIndex + 2;

    Finding its parent using decendent index;
        parentIndex = Math.floor(childIndex/2)-1;

What is priority Queue?
    - It will always return an item with the highest priority.

Complexity: Inserting or removing will always be O(log n)
